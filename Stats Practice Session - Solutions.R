#10 Assuming the age is following normal distribution
#11 What is the propability of a person with age greater than 50

#18 Is there a difference in mean age of Males anf Females on Titanic?
#19 Set a Alternate hypothesis and Null hypothesis 

#20 Alternate hypothesis is Mean age of Men is greater than mean age of females
